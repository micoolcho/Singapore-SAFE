# Singapore-SAFE
This is a Singapore-friendly version of the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) financing document open sourced by Y Combinator (see here: https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/).

SAFE comes in a few variations; the version here is based on the "Cap and Discount" type.

- [Google Docs file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZXPBn5z9TXvUY6oG1OF0vA6uKIP42IDoPNtY3T9mNg/edit?usp=sharing) with font formatting. Feel free to comment.

- Will try to keep this txt file and Google Docs file in Sync.

- Highly recomend you read YC's [Safe Primer](https://www.ycombinator.com/docs/SAFE_Primer.rtf) which explans why, whay, how and provides examples.

A Singapore-based lawyer was engaged (kudos to one of my investors) to modify the original SAFE by YC in order to make it more relevant within Singapore context. There're no material changes for the commercial terms; only the US-centric parts (eg. references to the Securities Act) have been removed while a few Singapore-specific points were added. 

I'll certainly welcome more contributors with background in Singapore commercial laws to chip in and improve this document. 

Hopefully this will come in handy for aspiring entrepreneurs in Singapore. And of course, hats off to YC for open sourcing SAFE in the first place!
