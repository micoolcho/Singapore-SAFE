  1. Events

  (a) Equity Financing. If there is an Equity Financing before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the Investor a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Conversion Price.

  In connection with the issuance of Safe Preference Shares by the Company to the Investor pursuant to this Section 1(a):
    (i) The Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preference Shares, with appropriate variations for the Safe Preference Shares if applicable, and provided further, that such documents have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including, without limitation, limited representations and warranties (which shall only relate to the title to the Safe Preference Shares) and limited liability and indemnification obligations (which shall also only relate to the title to the Safe Preference Shares) on the part of the Investor; and
    (ii) The Investor and the Company will execute a Pro Rata Rights Agreement, unless the Investor is already included in such rights in the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing.

  (b) Liquidity Event. Upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, the Investor will elect (at his sole and absolute discretion and subject to notifying the Company in writing within fourteen (14) days of such date) to either (i) receive a cash payment equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the following paragraph) or (ii) receive from the Company a number of Ordinary Shares equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price. If the Company does not receive any written notification from the Investor of his election within the prescribed period, then the Investor shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Ordinary Shares as described at Section (b)(ii).

  In connection with Section (b)(i), the Purchase Amount will be due and payable by the Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Liquidity Event. If there are not enough funds to pay the Investor and holders of other Safes (collectively, the "Cash-Out Investors") in full, then all of the Company’s available funds will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to their Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of Ordinary Shares equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price.

  (c) Dissolution Event. Upon the occurrence of a Dissolution Event, an amount equal to the Purchase Amount shall become due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the Dissolution Event. To the extent permitted by law, the Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Company to its shareholders. If immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the Investor and all holders of all other Safes (the "Dissolving Investors"), as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Investors of their respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Investors in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1(c).

  (d) Termination. This Agreement will terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement) upon either (i) the issuance of Shares to the Investor pursuant to Section 1(a) or Section 1(b)(ii); or (ii) the payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to Section 1(b)(i) or Section 1(c).
